    HTML parsing in 3 types

    1. normal is script
    2. async script
    3. defer

    the diff are when normal parsing

    1. HTML parsing goes on, when its encountered script tag its starts downloading script or getting from network, then execute and HTML parse continues.
    2. HTML parsing goes on, when script tag found then parallel script downloading goes with HTML parsing, after that execution of script happens, HTML parse continues.
    3. HTML parsing in parallel script downloads and without execute it continues HTML parse, when HTML parse done script starts execute.
