        Client-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) are three different
        approaches to generating and rendering web pages.

    <h1 style="color: #0066cc;">
        Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
    </h1>

    <h3 style="color: #008080;">
        How it works:
    </h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            In CSR, the entire application is loaded in the browser, and the rendering of the UI happens on the client
            side.
            The initial HTML is minimal, often just a container for the JavaScript application.
            JavaScript is responsible for fetching data from the server and rendering the UI dynamically.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Pros:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Faster initial page load, as only a lightweight HTML file is initially sent to the client.
            Interactivity and dynamic updates are possible without full page reloads.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Cons:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Slower perceived page load time, especially on slower devices or network connections.
            Search engine optimization (SEO) can be challenging, as search engines might not wait for JavaScript
            execution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 style="color: #0066cc;">
        Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
    </h1>

    <div>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            How it works:
        </h3>
        <p>
            In SSR, the server generates the HTML for each request and sends a fully rendered page to the client.
            Initial HTML content includes the rendered UI and data fetched from the server.
            JavaScript is still used for client-side interactivity, but the initial page load is more complete.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Pros:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Faster perceived page load time, as the client receives a fully rendered page.
            Better SEO, as search engines receive fully rendered content.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Cons:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Potentially higher server load, as the server has to generate HTML for each request.
            Slower initial page load compared to CSR in some cases.
        </p>

    </div>
    <h1 style="color: #0066cc;">
        Static Site Generation (SSG):
    </h1>
    <h3 style="color: #008080;">
        How it works:
    </h3>
    <div>
        In SSG, pages are pre-rendered at build time, and the generated HTML files are served statically.
        Content is fetched at build time, allowing for a fully static deployment.
        No server processing is needed for each user request.
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Pros:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Fastest page load time as static HTML files can be served directly from a content delivery network (CDN).
            Highly scalable, as there is no server processing for each request.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #008080;">
            Cons:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Limited dynamic content without additional client-side JavaScript for hydration.
            Content updates may require a rebuild of the entire site.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 style="color: #008080;">
        Use Cases:
    </h3>
    <p style="color: #333;">

        Use CSR for highly interactive applications where initial page load speed is less critical.
        Use SSR for applications that require good SEO and faster perceived page load times.
        Use SSG for content-centric sites, blogs, and landing pages where content doesn't change frequently, and fast
        page load times are crucial.

                Client-side: In client-side rendering, the browser downloads all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and then renders the web page on the user's device itself. This means that most of the processing, including rendering of content and handling user interactions, happens on the client's (user's) side. Examples include Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. In client-side rendering, the server typically only provides data through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
            </p>
            <p>
                Server-side: In server-side rendering, the web server processes the request from the client, generates the HTML content dynamically, and then sends the rendered HTML back to the client's browser. This means that the rendering of the web page happens on the server-side before it's sent to the client. Examples include traditional web applications built with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, or Express.js. In server-side rendering, the server handles both data processing and rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Static-side: Static site generation involves pre-rendering the entire website at build time, producing a collection of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These files are then served directly to the client without any additional processing on the server-side. This approach offers fast loading times and efficient caching since the content is already generated and ready to be served. Examples include websites built with static site generators like Gatsby.js, Next.js (with static export), Hugo, or Jekyll.
            </p>
In summary:

Client-side rendering shifts most of the processing to the client's browser, making it suitable for dynamic and interactive web applications. -- empty HTMl
Server-side rendering processes the content on the server before sending it to the client, providing better initial page load times and improved SEO. -- pre filled HTML 
Static site generation pre-renders the entire website at build time, offering fast performance and simplicity but with limited dynamic functionality. -- pre render
